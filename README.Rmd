# SOmap <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" />

The goal of SOmap is to make publication quality round Southern Ocean maps in polar projections with little effort. This package is still very much a work in progress contact me with any questions or suggestions.

## Installation
The development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/Maschette/SOmap) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Maschette/SOmap")
```
## Example

To make a simple map you can use the following function; use ?SOmap to see all the options for modifying layers.


```{r examplemap, fig.height=5,fig.width=5, dpi=300}
SOmap::SOmap()
```

There is also SOmanagement() which have management layers for the Southern Ocean and SOleg() which gives custom rounded legends for added map layers


```{r management, echo = T, fig.height=5,fig.width=5, dpi=300}
SOmap::SOmap()
SOleg(position="topright",
      col=spirited,
      ticks=6,
      tlabs = c("0","20","40","60","80","100"),
      Trim=-45,
      label="Sea Ice")
plot(ice, col=spirited, add=T,legend=FALSE, alpha=0.95) ## From raadtools
SOmap::SOmanagement(EEZ = T)
```
